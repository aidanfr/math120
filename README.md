MATH-UA 120 Discrete Mathematics

## Course Description
Topics included in this course are set theory, logic, algorithms, relations, functions, probability, number and graph theory. 
Discrete mathematics has many applications in computer science, operations research, chemistry, biology and the social sciences. 
We will study direct, contradiction, smallest counterexample, combinatorial and inductive proof techniques. 
An emphasis will be placed on developing “mathematical maturity”, the ability to reason logically and effectively communicate mathematical arguments.
